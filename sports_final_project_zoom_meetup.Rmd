# Final Project Zoom Meetup - Sports

Santos Hernandez

For my community contribution, I tried to connect people to project partners 
that had an interest in sports. After holding a poll on Piazza, I held a zoom 
session where people could find partners and brainstorm ideas for the final project. 
Although only a few people showed, everyone was able to find project partners, 
including myself!
