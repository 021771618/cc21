# (PART) Appendices {-}

This chapter contains additional information regarding how to setup the Github to build the book. 

# Github Initial Setup

1. Create a new repository. (For `cc21` I started with a new repo on GitHub since I wanted the main branch to be called `main` and that did not seem possible with **usethis** functions or RStudio "

2. Copy the following files from the previous version and edit as necessary.

```
_bookdown.yml
_common.R
_output.yml
appendix_initial_setup.Rmd
appendix_pull_request_tutorial.Rmd
DESCRIPTION               
index.Rmd                       
sample_project.Rmd
/.github
/resources/sample_project
/resources/tutorial_pull_request_mergers
```

3. Set up Secrets for GitHub Actions

* Secret #1: Create a token here https://github.com/settings/tokens and paste it in a secret in the repo named `GH_PAT`

* Secret #2: Add a Secret called `EMAIL` with GitHub email

See: https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/master/examples#managing-secrets


4. Create a `gh-pages` branch:
